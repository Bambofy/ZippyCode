To run the program:
1) Build the zippycodeserver project and copy the bridge/debug/ folder to a new directory.
2) build the zippycode project and copy the bridge/debug folder to the same directory.

e.g.
Copy the contents of "ZippyCode\ZippyCodeServer\bin\Debug\bridge" to "Build/ZippyCode/"

Copy the contents of "ZippyCode\ZippyCode\bin\Debug" to "Build/ZippyCode/ZippyCodeFrontend"

3) open Build/ZippyCode
4) run "node main.js"
5) connect to http://localhost:1337 (this will generate an ID for you.)
